                p This bike was built in Indonesia after test riding the best trikes from Denmark and finding them lacking for people transportation. It was made with imported Chromoly steel. The components are all quality brands found on bikes in the United States and Europe. I chose to design a pedicab in the Asian Jogja style because these trikes are superior in comfort, style and durability. The Jogja style Becak has a history of over 70 years. Mine has the following safety upgrades:

                  |- Large 203mm hydraulic front and rear disc brakes

                  br
                  |- Loud Auto Horn

                  |- Turn Signals &amp; Tail Lights

              .bd
                p I have a Cockatoo who would rather ride a bicycle than fly. Driving a pedicab is a job which keeps me fit and him amused.

              .bd
                p Initially, I was not intending to build a Becak, but rather to purchase a cargo bike from Denmark and add a passenger seat in the front cargo area. In Copenhagen I found that they had bike taxis which rode well, but had small wheels and lacked suspension. They were marketed for transporting seniors. These bikes are easy to get into, but they look unattractive and uncomfortable, due to lack of suspension.
                p I had visited Indonesia numerous times as a child. Thatâ€™s where I fell in love with Cockatoos and the iconic Jogja Becak. The Danish bikes while very nice cargo bikes, where initially designed for cargo, not passengers. The Becak was designed to transport people and their goods over pitted roads to the market.
